## General

### The Players
- There is a maximum of four *player*s in a game
- Each *player* starts the game with a *hand* containing five *card*s drawn from their *deck*
- the *player* that starts the first round does not get to *draw* a *card* that round
- A *player* can choose to discard any *card*s from the *field of play* or their *hand*
at the beginning of their turn. This is called the *discard phase*
- After the *discard phase* a *player* can draw one *card* from their *deck*
- A *player* can play as many *card*s as they want from their *hand* as long as they have the *resource*s
- A *player* begins a game with 10 *resource*
- A *player* begins a game with 2 *resource per turn* (rpt), but gains +1rpt every turn

### The Field of Play
For each *player*, *card*s exist in one of three places on the *field of play*:

- In the *player*'s *deck*
- In the *player*'s *hand*
- In the *player*'s *graveyard* (probably should use a different word for graveyard)

- Cards are put into play on the *field of play* from the *player*'s *hand*
- Unless a *card* is face-down an opponent can view the *card*'s details
- If a *player* wishes to take their *card* out of the *field of play* they must discard that *card*

### The Deck
- A deck has a maximum size of 40 *card*s
- A *player* only plays with one *deck* during a match
- The *deck* must be shuffled before play
- Discarded *card*s go to the bottom of the *player*'s *deck*
- Decks can only be comprised of cards of one faction and the netural card deck

### The Hand
- A *player*'s *hand*, in normal play, is not to be shown to other players.
- Maximum of seven *card*s in a *hand*
- Minimum of zero *card*s in a *hand*

### The Cards
**Card Types**

- Resource: give *resource*s to a player
- Attack: Attack *card*s on the field or a *players*'s HP
- Buff: Augment a *card*s attributes
- Trap: *Trap* *card*s apply negative effects to *player*s, the *field*, or a *card*. *Trap* *card*s come in two varieties:
 - *One-Time-Use*: The *card* is placed on the *field of play* face-down. Once *activated* (flipping the *card* face-up), the *card*s effects take place and the *trap* is *destroyed*. *Activation* may occur at any point during the game.
 - *Passive*: The *card* *activates* upon entering the *field of play*; the *card*'s effects last until it is destroyed.

**Faction Specific Card Abilities**
- Swarm cards of the same card name may do combined attacks where the card ATK values are added
  together in a focused attack to a selected card of the opponent.

**Card Rules**

- Every *card* can be attacked/destroyed
- A *card* may *attack* or *defend* once per turn except during the first round.
- A *card* may not *attack* on the turn it was played.
- Destroying an opponent's *card* awards the *player* with points
- Attacking another *player* directly awards the *player* with points
- A *player* may *attack* an opponent directly only when they don't have *card*s on the field.
- An *attack* *card* on the *field of play* can *attack* any *card* on the *field of play*
- A *defense* *card* on the *field of play* can *defend* any *card* on the *field of play*
- An attacking *card* must have a higher attack value than another *card*s defense value to damage its HP.
- When a *card*s HP is brought down to zero, the *card* is destroyed and sent to the *graveyard*
- Face-down *trap* *card*s may be attacked to flip them face-up (not *activating* them); the *player* may still activate them after this. Subsequent *attack*s may destroy the *trap* *card*.

### The Resources
Everything in-game is fueled by resources

- A *card* is brought to the *field of play* by buying that *card* unless it is a *resource* *card*
- A *player* can discard/sell-back a *card* on the *field of play*, receiving back a small portion of the cost to play that *card*
- A *resource* *card* can generate or steal *resource*s
- The maximum *resource* a *player* can accumulate is 20
