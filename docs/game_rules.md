## General

### The Players
- There is a maximum of four *player*s in a game
- Each *player* starts the game with a *hand* containing five *card*s drawn from their *deck*
- On the first turn a *player* does not draw a *card*
- A *player* can choose to discard any *card*s from the *field of play* or their *hand* 
at the beginning of their turn. This is called the *discard phase*
- After the *discard phase* a *player* can draw one *card* from their *deck*
- A *player* can play as many *card*s as they want from their *hand* as long as they have the *resource*s
- A *player* begins a game with 5 *resource*
- A *player* begins a game with +2 *resource* per turn

### The Field of Play
For each *player*, *card*s exist in one of three places on the *field of play*:

- In the *player*'s *deck*
- In the *player*'s *hand*
- In the *player*'s *graveyard*

- Cards are put into play on the *field of play* from the *player*'s *hand*
- Unless a *card* is face-down an opponent can view the *card*'s details
- If a *player* wishes to take their *card* out of the *field of play* they must discard that *card*

### The Deck
- A deck has a maximum size of 30 *card*s
- A *player* only plays with one *deck* during a match
- The *deck* must be shuffled before play
- Discarded *card*s go to the bottom of the *player*'s *deck*

### The Hand
- A *player*'s *hand*, in normal play, is not to be shown to other players.
- Maximum of seven *card*s in a *hand*
- Minimum of zero *card*s in a *hand*

### The Cards
**Card Types**

- Resource: give *resource*s to a player 
- Attack: Attack *card*s on the field or an *players*'s HP
- Defense: Defend *card*s on the field or a *player*s HP
- Buff: Augment a *card*s attributes
- Trap: Applies negative effects to a *player*, *deck*, *hand*, or *card*(s)

**Card Rules**

- Every *card* can be attacked/destroyed
- Destroying an opponent's *card* awards the *player* with points
- Attacking another *player* directly awards the *player* with points
- An *attack* *card* on the *field of play* can *attack* any *card* on the *field of play*
- A *defense* *card* on the *field of play* can *defend* any *card* on the *field of play*
- An attacking *card* must completely take down another *card*s defense before damaging its HP.
- When a *card*s HP is brought down to zero, the *card* is destroyed and sent to the *graveyard*

### The Resources
Everything in-game is fueled by resources

- A *card* is brought to the *field of play* by buying that *card*
- A *card* is kept on the field each turn after it is bought through *maintenance costs* unless it is a *resource* *card*
- A *player* can discard/sell-back a *card* on the *field of play*, receiving back a small portion of the cost to play that *card*
- A *resource* *card* can generate or steal *resource*s
- The maximum *resource* a *player* can accumulate is 20
